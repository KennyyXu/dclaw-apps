# dclaw-apps
Repository of D-Claw or Geoclaw applications.

---
## Summary
Application folders should be added under a parent folder of some kind (*eg,* dclaw-apps/flume/gate-release2020).

Folders should have at the very least:
* setrun.py
* Makefile

Optionally they might have:
* matlab plotting files (*eg,* afterframe.m)
* python scripts to set-up, for instance, topography.

## D-Claw version notes
It's probably a good idea to make a note of the D-Claw code in the application directory...either the code commit that was used or (if I get more organized and have version releases of the code) a version or tag.
